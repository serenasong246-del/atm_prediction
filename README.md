# ATM Cash Demand Analysis

## Description
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for ATM cash demand by leveraging statistical and machine learning models.
By accurately forecasting cash withdrawals, banks can optimize the distribution of cash across their ATM networks, reducing shortages and excess idle cash.

The dataset contains 22,000 observations and 7 predictor variables related to ATM location and environement. We compare a range of models from Multiple Linear Regression to Neural Networks to find the model with the most accurate prediction.

## Key Objectives 

- Improve cash flow management for banks.  
- Reduce operational costs associated with cash handling and transport.  
- Enhance customer satisfaction by ensuring ATMs are adequately funded.
